## Introduction

This repository is built for the implementation of two papers published in Animals: 1) "A comparison of semilandmarking approaches in the analysis of size and shape" published at *Animals* in 2023, please visit the website (https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/7/1179).
2) "A comparison of semilandmarking approaches in the visualisation of shape differences"published at *Animals* in 2023, please visit the website (https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/3/385). Please read the 'user manual.pdf' before running the software.



## Abstract
The performance of three landmark-driven semilandmarking approaches is assessed, using two different surface mesh datasets (ape crania and human heads) with different degrees of variation and complexity, by comparing the results of morphometric analyses. These approaches produce different semilandmark locations, which, in turn, lead to differences in statistical results, although the non-rigid semilandmarking approaches are consistent. Morphometric analyses using semilandmarks must be interpreted with due caution, recognising that error is inevitable and that results are approximations. Further work is needed to investigate the effects of using different landmark and semilandmark templates and to understand the limitations and advantages of different semilandmarking approaches.

Surfaces fitted to estimates of the mean and allometrically scaled landmark and semilandmark configurations arising from geometric morphometric analyses of these datasets are compared between semilandmarking approaches and different densities, as well as with those from warping to landmarks alone. We find that estimates of surface mesh shape (i.e., after re-semilandmarking and then re-warping) made with varying numbers of semilandmarks are generally consistent, while the warping of surfaces using landmarks alone yields surfaces that can be quite different to those based on semilandmarks, depending on landmark coverage and choice of template surface for warping. The extent to which these differences are important depends on the particular study context and aims.
